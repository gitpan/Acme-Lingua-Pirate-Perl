INSTALL:

This module be requirin' Module::Build to install, not that scurvy
ExtUtils::MakeMaker!

% ./Build
% ./Build test verbose=1
% ./Build install

I recommend you do the test step verbosely. Really, please do.

ABOUT:
A daft module to let you write Perl as a pirate might. Arrr!

AUTHOR:
Earle Martin <emartin@cpan.org>, but this module is basically
an adaptation of Acme::Lingua::Strine::Perl by Simon Wistow 
<simon@twoshortplanks.com>.

Hell, it took me longer to write the tests than the module....

COPYING:
This module is distributed under the same terms as Perl itself.
