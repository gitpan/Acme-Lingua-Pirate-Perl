        Even more piratey goodness! Flexible pluralization and articles,
          "the rope's end" for $/, "bilge: " for __DATA__, "poop deck: " 
          for __END__, and more random interjections - which are now
          case-insensitive and can be mixed and matched.

        Changed "the treasure" and "the booty" to represent @_. $_ is now
          "the doubloons" and "the gold". Added  "Davy Jones' Locker" for
          $@ and "a whale" for $!. Also gave "hornpipe" ($%) the article "a"
          to match the style of other phrases.
